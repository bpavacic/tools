# Step 1: Stitch GoPro videos that the camera split into multiple files into a single file.

# Step 2: Rename files and set filesystem timestamps.
#

# Step 3: Set videos time to be in UTC.
#
# Now that file names contain (local) time when the videos were recorded, adjust the time in .mp4
# metadata to be in UTC time zone and conform to .mp4 standards. GoPros unfortunatelly don't have a
# notion of time zones which makes time in metadata always wrong.
#
# IMPORTANT: Make sure you run this step only once and that both the GoPro and your computer have
# correct (local) time set.

# Step 4: Compress files to save space using H.264 compression.
#
# Output files have "-h264" suffix added and the original files are removed. 
#
# TODO(bobo): Compression script to be revisited and modified to copy GoPro-specific data streams
#             properly.
